### Year of Study

Third Year

### Major

Psychology

### Reason for enrolling in this course

Iâ€™ve always wanted to learn at least the basics of coding, and while I did try ~~and failed~~ to teach myself a few years back, Iâ€™m glad I enrolled in a class that would give actual structure and guidance. I also think itâ€™s a useful skill both in research-based tasks as well as outside of academia.

### What got me interested in psychology

My interest in psychology started in middle school. I remember us exploring different jobs for a career fair related event and learning exactly what therapists/counsellors did. Being amidst teenage angst and complicated feelings in middle school, and later on being a firsthand witness to the consequences of stigmatizing mental health, I wanted to further understand or at the very least be able to help others who struggled with their mental wellbeing.

### Post-grad plans

So far Iâ€™m going to take a gap year to figure things out, but I would love to get into something forensics related!
